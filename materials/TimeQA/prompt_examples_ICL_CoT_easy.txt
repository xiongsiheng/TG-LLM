Terry Cooper ( footballer , born 1944 ) Terence Cooper ( born 12 July 1944 ) is an English former football player and manager born in Brotherton , West Riding of Yorkshire . He was a full-back in the Leeds United team of the 1960s and 1970s . Early career . Cooper was not discovered as a young player in the conventional manner - he simply turned up at Leeds United one day with his football boots in a paper bag , asking for a trial . He was granted his wish and impressed enough to be offered an apprentice contract . Initially a left winger , Cooper was converted to a defensive role by Leeds boss Don Revie on signing at the age of 17 . He made gradual progress in the first team over the next six years until Revie decided to make him the permanent No.3 in 1966 . Cooper settled in thereafter earning a reputation as a full back of innovation , showing that the right levels of fitness , skill and an ability to cross the ball meant he could perform a devastating overlap down the left flank to support much feared winger Eddie Gray , this was so successful it became a trademark of Leeds play . He could also go inside , joining attacks centrally and scoring some important goals . 1960s . In 1968 , Leeds won the League Cup against Arsenal at Wembley . A poor and occasionally high-tempered match was settled by Coopers volley after a corner had been half-cleared , although Arsenal claimed their goalkeeper had been fouled by central defender Jack Charlton . Cooper subsequently featured in the team which won the Fairs Cup in the same season . In 1969 , Leeds won the League championship with Cooper making his contribution . Revie did not buy a reserve left back but instead used the utility player Paul Madeley to replace Cooper in the event of injury or suspension - an indication that Cooper was the finished article . This was further proved when he was given his debut for England by Alf Ramsey against France the same year , and England won 5â€“0 with Cooper putting on a classy individual showing . 1970s . Leeds chased three trophies in 1970 but lost the championship by nine points to Everton , and went out of the European Cup to Celtic in the semi-finals . Cooper played a full role in these near-misses , and also featured in the FA Cup final against Chelsea which Leeds lost 2-1 after a replay . In the summer , Cooper gave an excellent series of performances as Englands first choice left back at the World Cup in Mexico , which ended with defeat in the quarter-finals to West Germany . Leeds won the Fairs Cup again in 1971 but missed out on the League on the last day . One consolation for Cooper on a personal level was that this was his best season for appearances , missing just one League game all season . He seemed set to follow suit the next season as Leeds again chased League and FA Cup honours , but then suffered a broken leg in April 1972 during a League game at Stoke City . Aside from missing that seasons FA Cup final victory over Arsenal , Cooper missed a whole 20 months of football , such were the complications of the injury . Even when he did return to action , he played only one more international game , against Portugal in 1974 , after Don Revie had become England manager . Revie , unable to use Madeley who was already deputising as a central defender due to Jack Charltons retirement , bought Trevor Cherry in the summer of 1972 as a replacement . Cooper also missed the 1973 FA Cup final defeat to Sunderland and the European Cup Winners Cup final loss to A.C . Milan . When he did come back , it was with just two appearances in the 1974 season , thereby missing out on a League championship medal - Leeds won it with a 29-match unbeaten start - due to a lack of games . Coopers Leeds career was effectively over by the time he regained his fitness . The departure of Revie for the England job in 1974 and the emergence over the next season of Frank Gray , younger brother of Eddie , as well as the presence of Cherry , rendered Cooper surplus to requirements . He left the club in 1975 to join Middlesbrough who were managed by former Leeds teammate Charlton . Later career . After three years with Middlesbrough , he moved on to Bristol City for a year , before becoming player-manager of rivals Bristol Rovers . He subsequently assisted and played for his former Leeds skipper Billy Bremner at Doncaster Rovers , and had a second spell playing for and managing Bristol City , whom he led to two Freight Rover Trophy finals , winning the trophy in 1986 . His management career also took in a period at the helm of Birmingham City sandwiched between two spells at Exeter City .
