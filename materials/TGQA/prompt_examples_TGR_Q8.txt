Question: True or false: event (Liam Mitchell was married to Maddox Reynolds) was longer in duration than event (Emma Scott was married to Liam Mitchell)?

Useful information:
1885 before 1893 before 1916 before 1918 before 1922 before 1928 before 1941
1918 - 1916 = 2
1928 - 1893 = 35
1928 - 1922 = 6
1941 - 1918 = 23
2 < 6 < 23 < 35

Let's think step by step.

Thought: To determine whether the statement is true or false, we need to compare the durations of (Liam Mitchell was married to Maddox Reynolds) and (Emma Scott was married to Liam Mitchell) . The duration for each event can be calculated as follows:

(Liam Mitchell was married to Maddox Reynolds) :
(Liam Mitchell was married to Maddox Reynolds) starts at 1922
(Liam Mitchell was married to Maddox Reynolds) ends at 1928
1928 - 1922 = 6

(Emma Scott was married to Liam Mitchell) :
(Emma Scott was married to Liam Mitchell) starts at 1916
(Emma Scott was married to Liam Mitchell) ends at 1918
1918 - 1916 = 2

Now, we compare the duration of the two events: 6 is greater than 2.

Answer: True
